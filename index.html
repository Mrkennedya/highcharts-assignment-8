  <h1>Analyzing Election Trends Before the 2018 Midterms</h1>

  <p>Alachua County has always favored Democratic voters since 2008 – this has not changed in the time between. Republican registered voters increased nearly 18 percent between 2008 and 2018, while Democrat registered voters increased only 7 percent. However, Democrats hold a 36,593 voter lead on the Republican voters in Alachua County.</p>

  <h1>The Rise of Non-Party Support</h1>

  <p>More and more, Alachua County residents are switching their party status to No Party Affiliation, or NPA, as opposed to being a Republican, Democrat and smaller thrid-party voter. Since the 2008 elections, more than 15,000 voters registered or transitioned to NPA status – from 27,218 voters to 42,575 voters. On the flip side, third-party membership decreased drastically in the same time, including a 60 percent decrease between 2016 and 2018.</p>
